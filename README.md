# Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM
Welcome to the Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM repository! This project focuses on utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, to predict and forecast stock market prices. This README file provides an overview of the project, its contents, and instructions to get started. 

## Project Overview:
The Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM project aims to leverage the power of deep learning to predict and forecast stock market prices. By analyzing historical stock market data and incorporating features like technical indicators, this project explores the potential of Stacked LSTM models to capture the temporal dependencies and patterns within the financial time series.

## Project Structure:
The project repository is organized as follows:

- data/: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. The dataset files are named train.csv and test.csv, representing the training and testing data, respectively.
- notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the code used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The notebooks are labeled in a sequential manner, making it easy to follow the project workflow.
- models/: This directory stores trained Stacked LSTM models. Model files are saved with the extension .h5.
- README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
